## 🔧 Required Steps to Complete Sign in with Apple

### 1. Apple Developer Console Configuration

#### A. Enable Sign in with Apple for your App ID
1. Go to [Apple Developer Console](https://developer.apple.com/account/)
2. Navigate to **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles**
3. Click **Identifiers** → **App IDs**
4. Select your Merchies app identifier
5. Find **Sign in with Apple** in the capabilities list
6. Check the box to enable it
7. Click **Save** and confirm

#### B. Configure Sign in with Apple Service
1. Still in **Identifiers**, click **Services**
2. Find your **Sign in with Apple** service
3. Click **Configure**
4. Add your app's App ID to the list
5. Set up email relay (optional but recommended)
6. Click **Save**

### 2. Xcode Project Configuration

#### A. Add Sign in with Apple Capability
1. Open your Xcode project
2. Select your app target
3. Go to **Signing & Capabilities** tab
4. Click **+ Capability**
5. Add **Sign in with Apple**
6. Ensure it shows up in your entitlements

#### B. Verify App Store Connect Configuration
1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/)
2. Navigate to your app
3. Go to **App Information**
4. Ensure **Sign in with Apple** is listed in capabilities

### 3. Firebase Console Configuration

#### A. Enable Apple Sign In Provider
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your Merchies project
3. Go to **Authentication** → **Sign-in method**
4. Find **Apple** in the providers list
5. Click **Enable**
6. Configure the OAuth redirect URL (usually auto-configured)
7. Click **Save**

#### B. Add iOS App Configuration (if needed)
1. In Firebase Console, go to **Project Settings**
2. Under **Your apps**, find your iOS app
3. Ensure Bundle ID matches your Xcode project
4. Download and add the latest `GoogleService-Info.plist` if needed

### 4. Testing Sign in with Apple

#### A. Device Requirements
- **Physical iOS device** (Sign in with Apple doesn't work in simulator for full testing)
- **iOS 13.0+** (minimum requirement for Sign in with Apple)
- **Apple ID signed in** on the device

#### B. Test Scenarios
1. **First Time Sign In**: Creates new Firebase user
2. **Subsequent Sign Ins**: Uses existing Firebase user
3. **Email Hidden**: User chooses to hide email from app
4. **Email Shared**: User allows app to see their email
5. **Name Sharing**: User provides or hides their name
6. **Cancellation**: User cancels the sign in process

### 5. Production Considerations

#### A. Privacy Benefits
- **Email Relay**: Apple can generate private relay emails
- **No Password Required**: Enhanced security with Face ID/Touch ID
- **Minimal Data Sharing**: Users control what information is shared
- **Two-Factor Built-in**: Apple ID 2FA provides additional security

#### B. User Experience
- **Fast Authentication**: One-tap sign in after initial setup
- **Familiar Interface**: Native iOS authentication flow
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Works across all user's Apple devices
- **Privacy First**: Clearly communicates what data is shared

### 6. Debugging and Troubleshooting

#### A. Common Issues

**Issue**: "Invalid nonce" error
**Solution**: Check that nonce generation is working properly
```swift
// Verify this code is working in AuthViewModel
private func randomNonceString(length: Int = 32) -> String {
    // Implementation provided
}
```

**Issue**: Firebase authentication fails
**Solution**: Verify Firebase Apple provider is enabled and configured

**Issue**: User profile not created
**Solution**: Check Firestore security rules allow user document creation

#### B. Debugging Steps
1. **Enable Debug Logging**: Add Firebase debug logging
2. **Check Console Output**: Look for Apple Sign In specific logs
3. **Test Network Connectivity**: Ensure Firebase can be reached
4. **Verify Certificates**: Check that your app signing is correct

### 7. App Store Review Guidelines

#### A. Required for App Store
If your app uses other third-party sign-in options (like Google, Facebook), **Sign in with Apple must be offered as an option** according to App Store Review Guidelines 4.8.

#### B. Implementation Requirements
- [x] **Equivalent Functionality**: Apple Sign In provides same features as other sign-in methods
- [x] **Prominent Placement**: Apple Sign In button is prominently displayed
- [x] **Official Button**: Using Apple's official `SignInWithAppleButton`
- [x] **No Degraded Experience**: Users get full app functionality

### 8. User Data Handling

#### A. Privacy Compliance
```swift
// Our implementation handles privacy correctly:
private func createUserProfile(user: User, displayName: String?, email: String?) {
    // Only stores data that user explicitly shared
    // Respects Apple's private email relay
    // Creates minimal user profile in Firestore
}
```

#### B. Data Minimization
- Only request necessary scopes: `.fullName, .email`
- Handle case where user hides email
- Store minimal user data in Firestore
- Respect user's privacy choices

### 9. Testing Checklist
