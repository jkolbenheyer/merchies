## üîí Security Considerations

### Payment Data
- Apple Pay tokenizes card data - actual card numbers never touch your servers
- Stripe handles all PCI compliance
- No changes needed to your existing payment flow

### Authentication
- Apple Pay requires biometric or passcode authentication
- This adds an extra security layer beyond your app's authentication

## üé® UI/UX Considerations

### Apple Pay Button
The Stripe PaymentSheet automatically shows Apple Pay when:
- Device supports Apple Pay
- User has cards in Wallet
- Merchant ID is properly configured

### Fallback Options
Your existing credit card input will remain available as a fallback when:
- Apple Pay is not available
- User chooses not to use Apple Pay
- Apple Pay authentication fails

## üì± User Experience

### What Users Will See
1. **Payment Sheet**: Apple Pay button appears at the top
2. **Apple Pay Sheet**: Native iOS payment interface
3. **Authentication**: Touch ID/Face ID prompt
4. **Confirmation**: Order confirmation with Apple Pay transaction

### Benefits for Users
